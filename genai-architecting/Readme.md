## Functional Requirements

Company wants to own its infra for privacy concerns and costs considerations.
They would like to buy specialised hardware for AI around 10-15k.

A total of 300 active students located within Tokyo.

## Assumtions 

We assume open source LLMs will be quick and capable enough to handle the traffic.
We use our own server connected to internet with enough bandwidth to serve 300 students.

## Data Strategy

We purchase supply materials and store them for access in our database.

## Considerations

We consider using IBM Granite for LLM as it is truly open source model with training dataset made public so we can avoid any copyright issues and the model is explainable.
